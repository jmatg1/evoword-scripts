# Installation
To use this script you need `Tampermonkey` extension ([link](https://tampermonkey.net/)). Analogues can work too.

Open this ([link](https://github.com/jmatg1/evoword-scripts/raw/main/zoom-hack.user.js)). If you have `TamperMonkey` installed, you should see dialog window.

Click `Install` and you're done.
